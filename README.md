![TravelPal Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=TravelPal)

## üìã Overview

TravelPal is an innovative AI-powered travel planning assistant that creates personalized travel itineraries with minimal user input.

   ITINERARY_PROMPT = "prompts/itinerary.txt"
   ```

5. Create the prompt files in a `prompts` folder (examples provided in the repository)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the App

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üì± Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. When you first open TravelPal, you'll be greeted with a welcome message
2. Simply type your destination in the chat input, for example:
   - "I want to visit Paris for 4 days"
   - "Plan a trip to Tokyo"
   - "I'm thinking of going to Switzerland"

### Providing Details (Optional)

TravelPal only needs a destination to create an itinerary, but you can provide additional details if you wish:
- Duration: "I want to stay for 7 days"
- Budget: "I'm looking for a budget-friendly trip" or "I want a luxury experience"
- Preferences: "I'm interested in hiking, museums, and local cuisine"

### Generating an Itinerary

Once you've provided your destination, TravelPal will automatically generate a personalized itinerary. If it needs any additional information, it will ask just one simple question before proceeding.

### Viewing and Managing Your Trip

- Your trip information is displayed in the collapsible "Trip Information" panel
- The itinerary will appear in the chat interface
- You can ask follow-up questions about your itinerary or request modifications

- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files (`.env`, credentials)

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md).

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up your API key** (securely in a `.env` file):
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
